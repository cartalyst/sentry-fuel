[READONLY] - Moved to cartalyst/sentry
===========


This repo is **no longer available** at this url.

We have released Sentry 2.0, which is a framework agnostic package with built in support for FuelPHP. It is located over at [cartalyst/sentry](http://www.github.com/cartalyst/sentry).

If you are looking for legacy code please follow the following:

1. If you were running on the `master` branch, you should now run off `fuelphp/1.0/master`.
2. If you were running off the `develop` branch, you should now run off `fuelphp/1.1/develop`
3. If you were running off the `2.0/master` or `2.0/develop` branch, you should now run off `fuelphp/2.0/master`
4. If you were running off the `2.1/develop` branch, you should now run off `fuelphp/2.0/develop`.

Manuals for the old FuelPHP package can be found [here](http://sentry.cartalyst.com/manual/v1.1.html).


The FuelPHP branches will no longer be maintained, however pull requests are still welcome. We urge everybody to move towards the new and greater Sentry 2.0, which works much better and outside the limitations of any given framework!

Thanks,

Ben Corlett.
